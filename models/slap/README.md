## Abstract

Joint embedding spaces have significantly advanced music understanding and generation by linking text and audio through multimodal contrastive learning. However, these approaches face large memory requirement limitations due to relying on large batch sizes to effectively utilize negative samples. Further, multimodal joint embedding spaces suffer from a modality gap wherein embeddings from different modalities lie in different manifolds of the embedding space.

To address these challenges, we propose **Siamese Language-Audio Pretraining (SLAP)**, a novel multimodal pretraining framework that allows learning powerful representations without negative samples. SLAP adapts the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) paradigm for multimodal audio-text training, promoting scalability in training multimodal embedding spaces. SLAP outperforms CLAP on text-music retrieval and zero-shot classification, and is robust to batch size and modality gap issues.

---

## Highlights
- **No negatives needed:** BYOL-style training for audio-text, removing the need for large batch sizes and negative pairs.
- **Scalable:** Enables large-scale training on a single GPU via gradient accumulation.
- **Reduced modality gap:** Embeddings from different modalities are better aligned.
- **Strong performance:** Outperforms CLAP on text-music retrieval and zero-shot classification.
- **PyTorch Lightning + Hydra:** Modular, reproducible, and easy to configure.

# SLAP: Siamese Language-Audio Pretraining Without Negative Samples for Music Understanding

## Usage

To train a model, define your configuration in a YAML file (see `configs/` for examples) and run:

```shell
python src/train.py data=<your_data_config> model=<your_model_config> model/audio_encoder=<your_audio_encoder> model/text_encoder=<your_text_encoder> logger=<your_logger>
```

You can override any config option from the command line, e.g.:
```shell
python src/train.py model/audio_encoder=htsat_slap
```

See the [Hydra docs](https://hydra.cc/) for more info on configuration overrides.


## Code organization

This repo is implemented with [Pytorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/latest/).
For configuration files, it uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc).
The structure follows this [lightning-hydra-template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template).

This repo is divided in the following subpackages:
- `configs` contains the recursively defined Hydra configs as YAML files.
- `src` contains the main code:
  - `callbacks` contains home-made callbacks, e.g. for custom logging and visualization.
  - `data` contains data-related stuff, it is divided in `datamodules` (for loading data) and `transforms` for pre-processing, data augmentations, etc.
  - `models` contains main structures implemented as `LightningModule`s. Training procedures should be implemented here.
  A `BaseModule` is already implemented to handle basics.
  - `networks` contains the architectures of neural networks provided as **standard PyTorch** `nn.Module`s.
  In practice, those networks shouldn't be used directly but given as arguments of a `LightningModule` implemented in `models`.
  - `utils` contains almost everything else. In particular, losses and colorful loggers are defined here.

---

## Detailed Usage

### Training

- **Train locally:**
  ```shell
  python src/train.py data=<your_data_config> model=<your_model_config> model/audio_encoder=<your_audio_encoder> model/text_encoder=<your_text_encoder> logger=<your_logger>
  ```
- **Config customization:**
  Edit YAML files in `configs/` or override from the command line, e.g. `model/audio_encoder=htsat_slap`.

### Evaluation

- **Evaluate on test set:**
  ```shell
  python src/train.py test=true ckpt_path=path/to/checkpoint.ckpt
  ```
- **Resume training:**
  ```shell
  python src/train.py resume=true ckpt_path=path/to/checkpoint.ckpt
  ```

### Configuration
- All experiment settings are controlled via Hydra YAML configs in `configs/`.
- See `configs/train.yaml` for the main entry point.
- Paths, model, data, and trainer settings are modular and can be overridden from the command line.

## Feature Extraction & Zero-Shot Example

You can use the model to extract features or perform zero-shot similarity as follows:

**Extract audio/text features:**
```python
# Assume 'model' is a loaded SLAP or MusCALL model
# audio: torch.Tensor of shape [batch, ...], text: list of strings
_, audio_emb = model.encode_audio(audio)
_, text_emb = model.encode_text(text)
```

**Zero-shot similarity (e.g., retrieval or probing):**
```python
# Normalize and compute similarity
import torch.nn.functional as F
sim = F.cosine_similarity(audio_emb, text_emb)  # or use (audio_emb @ text_emb.T)
# sim: similarity scores between audio and text
```

---

## Dataset Preparation

SLAP is designed to be flexible: you can use the provided `AudioCSVDataset` (see `src/data/audio_csv.py`) or define your own PyTorch `Dataset` or Lightning `DataModule` for custom data formats.

**Default CSV-based dataset:**
- Prepare a CSV file with columns: `npy_path`, `caption`, `set` (where `set` is one of `train`, `val`, or `test`).
- Audio or spectrogram files should be referenced by `npy_path` (relative to your data root).

Example directory structure:
```
data/
├── audio/
│   ├── track_1.wav
│   ├── track_2.wav
│   └── ...
├── captions.csv  # or .json, with columns: npy_path, caption, set
```

- Update `configs/paths/example.yaml` with your data paths.
- See `configs/data/default.yaml` for expected config fields and how to point to your CSV.
- To use a custom dataset, implement your own `LightningDataModule` and update the `_target_` in your data config.

=======
## Long Story Generation
The story transcript is in `data/long_story_transcript.txt`. To replicate the audio generation with IndicParler-TTS, run `long-story-generation/long_story_generation.py` to get audio samples for ~100 tokens segments. Then, run `long-story-generation/stitch_stories.py` to stitch together all the samples in order into `full_story.wav`. Based on previous generations, IndicParler-TTS seems to have a maximum audio generation length of 30 seconds, so 100 tokens is about the maximum generation length where no samples are 30 seconds long. Longer generations (~300+ tokens) result in incoherent speech.

## Rasa Model Comparison
The code in the `rasa-model-comparison` folder creates the Hugging Face table that runs inference on **IndicParler-TTS** and **ElevenLabs-V3** and then allows you to compare the results to **Rasa**'s ground truth. Run `rasa_model_comparison.csv` to create the 96 total generations for IndicParler-TTS and Elevenlabs-V3 along with the full dataset, then run `hf_commit.py` to commit the dataset to Hugging Face where you can listen to the audio samples instead of seeing the raw bytes.
